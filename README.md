## A simple password manager

This is a password manager I implemented as a course project. 
It was made for the purpose of my personal education and should not be used to store passwords safely.

### Usage

The password manager operates in the terminal. 

```
python pw_manager/__main__.py
```
Upon first usage, a database and master password is created. Once the database is existant, the user is prompted to provide the password to access it. 

### Functionalities 
- View all entries 
- Create new entry 
- View entry and copy password
- Update entry 
- Delete entry 
- Generate random password 
- Quit
